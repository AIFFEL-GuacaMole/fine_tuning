# Introduction

This is the official code and data repository of "Enhancing Molecular Property Prediction via Mixture of Collaborative
Experts". The repository will be continuously updated.

# Data Preparation

If you run our code main.py, the dataset will be automatically downloaded. But if you need to use the same dataset
partition as ours, you need to download the file cache.tar.gz from the link below and unzip it in the root directory.
